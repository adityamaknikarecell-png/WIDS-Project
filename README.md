Week 1: Data Foundations and Basic Metrics
The first week was  about getting comfortable with the basic tools and concepts . We worked through a fill in the blank assignment designed to help us understand how to turn raw stock price data into meaningful financial metrics. I learned what a portfolio actually is and explored the different types of assets you can invest in. We spent a lot of time understanding returns, particularly the difference between simple returns  and log returns . Risk was another big focus , we measured it using volatility and standard deviation. Looking at how much stock prices bounce around. We also explored how different stocks relate to each other through correlation and covariance, which tell us whether stocks tend to move together or in opposite directions. For the technical implementation, I used yfinance to pull three years of historical data for three Indian stocks (RELIANCE.NS, TCS.NS, and HDFCBANK.NS), then created visualizations with matplotlib. The correlation heatmap was particularly useful for seeing which stocks move in sync, while the scatter plot let me compare each stock's risk against its expected return. Everything was annualized using 252 trading days per year to get meaningful yearly metrics.

Week 2: Portfolio Simulation and the Efficient Frontier
 The assignment wasn't just fill in the blank anymore ,we had to interpret our results and explain what they meant. I learned that every optimization problem has three essential parts: the decision variables , the objective function , and the constraints . We used a brute force computational approach where the computer generated thousands of random weight combinations using a step size of 0.02, meaning weights changed in 2% increments. For each combination, we calculated the portfolio's return and risk, then plotted everything to create this cloud of dots representing all possible portfolios. The nice part was identifying the Efficient Frontier which is the upper edge of this cloud where you get the maximum possible return for any given level of risk. These are the only portfolios a rational investor should ever consider because anything below the frontier means you're getting less return than you could for the same amount of risk. We also found the Minimum Variance Portfolio, which is the single safest combination of stocks you can hold. To understand how diversification works  during market stress, we ran a stress test where we doubled the offdiagonal values in the covariance matrix, simulating what happens when assets start moving together during a crisis. The visualizations really helped  the risk surface showed how portfolio risk changes with different weight allocations, and the risk-return cloud made it obvious that most portfolios are inefficient.

Week 3: Introduction to Solvers and CVXPY
Instead of testing thousands of random portfolios and hoping to get close to the optimal solution, we started using CVXPY, which is a convex optimization library that uses calculus to solve for the exact optimal weights. We implemented Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization.The main goal was to construct the entire Efficient Frontier by solving the optimization problem repeatedly for different target returns or risk levels. We paid special attention to the Minimum Variance Portfolio and compared it against a naive equal weight strategy where you just split your money evenly across all five stocks.The mathematically derived portfolio consistently offered better risk-adjusted returns than the simple equal split approach. The key insight here was understanding that CVXPY doesn't just guess and check like our Week 2 approach but it uses mathematical solvers to find the continuous optimal solution.

Week 4: Modeling Risk Aversion
The final assignment brought everything together by adding the human element which is investor preferences.  Lambda represents how much an investor dislikes risk, and it completely changes what portfolio they should hold. A low lambda means the investor is risk seeking and cares mostly about maximizing returns even if it means high volatility, while a high lambda means they're risk averse and willing to sacrifice potential returns for a smoother, more stable portfolio. I built an interactive script that prompts users to input their own stock tickers and specify how many years of historical data to use, then solves the optimization problem forty times for different lambda values ranging from 0.01 to 1000. This effectively simulates forty different investor personalities, from extremely aggressive to extremely conservative. You can literally watch the portfolio composition shift as risk aversion increases. When lambda is low  the portfolio is dominated by volatile tech stocks like Amazon that offer high potential returns. As lambda increases, the weights gradually shift toward stable, defensive stocks like Johnson & Johnson.The right answer depends entirely on the investor's risk tolerance and investment goals.
