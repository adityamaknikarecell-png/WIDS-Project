In the first week , we were given a fill in the blank type assignment. 
In our first week we learnt about what a portfolio is, about asset classes,
about 2 types of return (simple and log), about risk , volatility,correlation,expected returns,
covariance and covariance matrix. We learnt how we can plot the covariance matrix and
expected return vs volatility graph using the matplotlib library

In week 2 there was again we had a fill in the blank type assignment but along with that we had to
write our observations regarding all the graphs formed. We learnt about optimization and that every optimization
has 3 core parts (a)Decision Variables,(b) Objective Function,(c) Constraints.
We learnt about convex problems and how to identify them. We finally learnt about Markowitz minimum-variance problem.
The graphs formed introduced us to the efficient frontier.

In week 3 we focussed on Markowitz Mean–Variance Optimization, in this we had the write all the code 
by ourselves but it was not that difficult as it was mostly similar to the last two assignment but in this one 
instead of guess and check method like in case of week 2, we used CVXPY library to get precise answers using 
calculus. The main goal was to construct efficient frontier with 3 or more assets.
